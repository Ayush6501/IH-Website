## The official website for Innovators Hub Student club, MIT Pune.

### Innovators Hub was founded in 2018, with the goal of using technology, research and innovation to address people's everyday concerns. The goal also was to help the students of MIT-WPU develop their projects and ideas and help them become well rounded individuals. 
### The club assists the students with their ideas from the ground up, whether they be software, hardware-based projects, or research. We train our recruits in their spheres of interests by equipping them with guidance and skills to unlock innovation. 
### In addition to this, we also organize a plethora of events and seminars for not just the members of the club, but for everyone as we want the students of our college to improve their skills and stay ahead of the curve.
### We have both a technical and non-technical wing. CSE, Mechanical and Electrical domains operate under the technical department whereas the non-tech department majorly focuses on organising and hosting events alongside content creation through various digital mediums.

### The Website attracts 1000-2000 monthly users and acts as a gateway for students and teachers alike to present groundbreaking project ideas or fund industrial projects.
